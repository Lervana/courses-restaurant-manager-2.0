# 09 - Functional app

## Functionalities:

- [ ] Full CRUD of menu, each menu position should have own category, name and price.

- [ ] Tables managing system - each indoor order should be assigned to certain table number. When all tables are set (max tables amount is set by configuration) new orders can be only "take away".
- [ ] When customer finish order (wants to pay), app should generate a bill - each order can be pay on one bill or split in more bills.
- [ ] It should be possible to convert prices to another currency in real time (connection to the currency API).
- [ ] Application should be able to generate reports - orders history by date.
